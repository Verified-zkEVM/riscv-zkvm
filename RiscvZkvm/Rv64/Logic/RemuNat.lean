  RiscvZkvm.Rv64.RemuNat

  `rv64_remu` as `Nat` remainder, and the divisibility test guest code actually
  writes (GH #11578).

  ## Why this file exists

  `rv64_divu` already had its `Nat` bridge — `rv64_divu_toNat`
  (`evm-asm's EvmAsm/Evm64/EvmWordArith/KnuthTheoremB.lean:101`). **`rv64_remu` had none**,
  anywhere in the tree: the only prior proof reasoning about a `DIVU`/`REMU` pair
  is `U256DivU64BeSAsm.lean`, and it keeps both **opaque** behind a mirror model
  (`divByteStep`, `:26-28`) rather than bridging to `Nat`.

  ⚠️ Homed here rather than beside its `divu` sibling on purpose. That sibling
  sits in a 600-line file about Knuth's Algorithm B, where a reader looking for a
  general remainder bridge will not find it — which is exactly the failure mode
  ("searching by name finds a name; only reading the statement finds the fact")
  that has now cost this project four rediscoveries. A one-purpose file with the
  statement in its name is the cheap fix.

  ## The shape callers want

  Guest code does not test divisibility as `a % b = 0` on `Nat`; it computes
  `remu` into a register and branches on `bnez`. So the load-bearing form is the
  **`= 0` iff**, not the `toNat` equation — `remu_eq_zero_iff_mod_eq_zero` below
  is what a `bnez` obligation reduces to in one rewrite.

/-- `rv64_remu` is `Nat` remainder on a non-zero divisor. The `b = 0` case
    returns `a` unchanged (RV64IM has no trap), and is excluded rather than
    folded in: every guest divisor this is used with is a non-zero literal, and
    silently absorbing the zero case would make the lemma true of a routine that
    never checked. -/
