  RiscvZkvm.Rv64.SailEquiv.StepRun

  Run-level Rv64 ↔ Sail simulation: lifts the one-instruction capstones to an
  arbitrary number of steps.

  The missing piece was the **fetch-side `nextPC := PC + 4` default**.  Every
  step-level theorem consumes `nextPC = pc + 4` and produces a state whose
  `nextPC` is the branch *target*, so `StateRelPC` cannot be iterated.  In real
  Sail the default is re-installed during fetch; `sailStep` below models exactly
  that (and only that) part of the vendored fetch, so the invariant `RunInv`
  — which carries no `nextPC` fact at all — is genuinely step-stable.

  The run-level tier is `Instr.simulable` — including `JALR`.  `JALR` was
  excluded from an earlier run-only predicate (`Instr.runSimulable`, now
  deleted) because the old extracted `currentlyEnabled` had no `Ext_Zicsr` arm,
  making `execute_JALR`'s leading `update_elp_state` fault in every state
  (#10688).  The regenerated model (sail-riscv 0.13.1, `Zicsr_insts` in
  scope) fixed that arm; `update_elp_state_noop` (`RunInv.lean`) proves the call
  is a bare-mode no-op, `jalr_sideCond_of_runInv` below discharges the `JALR`
  side condition from the standard invariant, and `jalr_sideCond_satisfiable`
  exhibits a concrete witness pair — the constructive mirror of the old
  for-all-states unsatisfiability.

-- Discharging the per-instruction side conditions from the run invariant
-- ============================================================================

/-- **The `JALR` side condition holds in every run-invariant state** — the
    constructive mirror of the #10688 defect.

    Before the scoped model regen, `¬ instrSideCond (.JALR ..)` was
    provable for **all** states (the extracted `currentlyEnabled` had no
    `Ext_Zicsr` arm, so the `update_elp_state` conjunct was unsatisfiable and
    `jalr_sail_equiv` was vacuous).  This theorem shows the fixed model's side
    condition is dischargeable from the standard run-level invariant: the
    mid-state witness is `sSail` itself, because `update_elp_state_noop` shows
    the Zicfilp bookkeeping is a bare-mode no-op.

    `h_nextpc` is extra to `RunInv` (which deliberately carries no `nextPC`
    fact): the `JALR` side condition inspects `nextPC`, which is only pinned
    *post-fetch*, after `sailStep` installs the `pc + 4` default. -/

    {rd rs1 : Reg} {offset : BitVec 12}
    (hinv : RunInv lo hi sRv sSail)
    (h_nextpc : sSail.regs.get? Register.nextPC = some (sRv.pc + 4))

/-- **The run-level invariant discharges every per-instruction Sail side
    condition.** Alignment comes from the toy `isValid*Access` guard (which
    `hguard` witnesses), window membership from `stepSideCond`, and everything
    else from `RunInv` itself.

    `h_nextpc` is consumed by the `JALR` arm alone (its side condition inspects
    `nextPC`, which `RunInv` deliberately does not constrain); the sole caller,
    `sailStep_run_sim`, applies this theorem at the post-fetch state where the
    `nextPC := pc + 4` default has just been installed, so the fact is free
    there. -/

-- One modelled step simulates one toy step
-- ============================================================================

/-- **One-step run-level simulation.**

    If the toy machine steps from `sRv` to `sRv'` on a simulable instruction,
    the modelled Sail step `sailStep si` retires successfully and
    the run-level invariant is re-established at the post-state.  **There is no
    `nextPC` hypothesis** — that is the point: `sailStep` installs the
    fetch-side default itself.

    ## Scope

    * **Simulable instructions only.** `ECALL`, `EBREAK`, `CSRS`, `FENCE` and the
      pseudo-instructions `MV`/`LI`/`NOP` are excluded (`toSailInstr?` maps them
      to `none`); the Sail model intentionally diverges from the toy model on
      syscalls and on the ZisK accelerator call.  `JALR` **is** covered: its
      historical exclusion (#10688 — the pre-regen model's `update_elp_state`
      faulted in every state) is resolved by `update_elp_state_noop` /
      `jalr_sideCond_of_runInv`.
    * **RAM-zone memory only.** Accesses are confined to a caller-chosen window
      `[lo, hi) ⊆ [RAM_MEM_START, RAM_MEM_END) = [0xa0000000, 0xc0000000)`.  This
      is not laziness: the toy model's legacy MEM zone `[0x20, 0x78000000]` is
      **not inside any readable PMA region** of `sailInitPmaRegions` (whose
      main-memory region is `[0x80000000, 0x100000000)`), so the Sail-side
      access checks are simply false there and the side conditions are
      unprovable. -/

/-- **The `JALR` side condition is satisfiable** — for every choice of `rd` and
    `rs1`, a concrete state pair witnesses `instrSideCond (.JALR rd rs1 0)`.

    This is the absolute-satisfiability mirror of #10688: under the pre-regen
    older model, `¬ instrSideCond (.JALR rd rs1 offset) sRv sSail` was
    provable for **all** states (so `jalr_sail_equiv`, `jalr_step_sail_equiv`
    and the `.JALR` arm of `step_execute_sail_sim` were vacuously true).  With
    the `Ext_Zicsr` arm restored, the witness below discharges every conjunct
    constructively; offset `0` with an all-zero register file satisfies the
    `(target &&& ~~~1) &&& 3 = 0` alignment conjunct.  The relative form —
    every `RunInv` state qualifies — is `jalr_sideCond_of_runInv`. -/
